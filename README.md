thyDungeonMan
=============

YOU ARE THY DUNGEONMAN!

Thy Dungeonman implemented with ncurses. (Therefore, Linux only.)  Play the original at http://www.homestarrunner.com/dungeonman.html.

This is a command-line game.

  make for regular version.
  make nosound if you just have ncurses.

You probably already have ncurses, but you need to install sfml though.
