Thy Dungeonman! Thy Hunger!
=============

YOU ARE THY DUNGEONMAN!

Thy Dungeonman implemented with ncurses. (Therefore, Linux only.)  Play the original at http://www.homestarrunner.com/dungeonman.html.

This is a command-line game.

  -```make``` for regular version.
  
  -```make nosound``` if you just have ncurses.

If you're on Linux, you probably already have ncurses, but you most likely need to install csfml though.
