thyDungeonMan
=============

YOU ARE THY DUNGEONMAN!

Thy Dungeonman implemented with ncurses. (Therefore, Linux only.)  Play the original at http://www.homestarrunner.com/dungeonman.html.

This is a command-line game. To "install," simply type make in the code directory, which will put an executable in the parent directory.

And, no, I'm not going to install ncurses for you. You probably already have it anyway.

You probably need to install sfml though.
